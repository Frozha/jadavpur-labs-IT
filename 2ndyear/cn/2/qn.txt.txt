BE-IT 2nd Year 2nd Semester
Assignments: Error Control & Flow Control

1. Implement the Simplest Protocol in C/C++ for sender-site DLL and receiver-site DLL
with the following the following elementary functionalities:
WaitForEvent(), GetData(), MakeFrame(), SendFrame(), ReceiveFrame(),

ExtractData(), DeliverData()
2. Implement Stop-n-wait protocol in C/C++ by considering:
a. Channel is noiseless
b. Channel is noisy (hint: introduce probability of damaging/losing the frame in
transit)

3. Implement Go-back-n based sliding window protocol in C/C++ by considering the
followings:
a. DLL communications are Non-NACK based
b. DLL communications are NACK based
c. DLL communications are Piggybacked based (i.e.. bi-directional communication)
4. Write a program in C/C++ with suitable functions to implement Selective-repeat based
sliding window protocol by considering the followings:
a. DLL communications are Non-NACK based
b. DLL communications are NACK based
c. DLL communications are Piggybacked based
5. Suppose there is a provision to let the sender know about the condition of the receiverâ€™s
buffer (i.e., buffer size is 1 or 2m-1

) by using a framing bit along with ACK. Write an
optimized sliding window protocol in C/C++ to improve performance of the DLL
communication systems
